    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>The event will take place at <a href="https://lacasonahotel.com/">Hotel La Casona Minera</a>, located in the heart of Mineral de Pozos, Guanajuato. This "Pueblo Mágico" enchants visitors with its historic ruins, cobblestone streets, pre-Hispanic music and instruments, and a rich tapestry of crafts, jewelry, traditions, legends, and temazcales. It is a place that promises a sanctuary of peace, tranquility, rich culture, and entertainment.</p>

    <p>The hotel offers fifteen well-appointed rooms. The recommended Double room features a single King-size bed, while the Quadruple room includes two Queen-size beds and can accommodate up to five guests, with each room providing a private bathroom. If you are traveling alone and open to the idea of sharing a room with another attendee, please indicate this preference on the registration form. This arrangement not only fosters networking but also makes the stay more economical.</p>

    <h2>Scientific Program & Workshops</h2>
    <p>While it is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged for every participant to present their scientific projects. This event offers a unique opportunity to share your scientific expertise and connect with like-minded individuals who are interested in your research areas. Engaging in these discussions can enhance your network and potentially lead to collaborative opportunities. Importantly, there is <strong>NO fee to attend/participate</strong> in any of the workshops, talks, or other sessions at the event, making it an even more accessible opportunity for all attendees.</p>

    <p>We offer two types of talks at the event:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Light Talk:</strong> Consists of a 10-minute presentation followed by a 5-minute question-and-answer session.</li>
        <li><strong>Keynote Talk (1 to 2 per day):</strong> Features a 25-minute presentation with an additional 5 minutes for questions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Participants are asked to provide a meaningful (preliminary) title during registration to facilitate the scheduling of talk sessions. To support the presentations, we will provide a video projector equipped with VGA and HDMI ports, as well as a laser pointer.</p>

    <p>The preliminary schedule of our scientific program will be announced soon. <em>TBA</em></p>
